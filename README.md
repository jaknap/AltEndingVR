# AltEndingVR

- This is an experimental demo using A-Frame, with the help of libraries like A-Frame Extras and A-Frame Video Controls
- The idea of this project was to create a system where you can select the ending of the video you are watching depending on your preference.

## Run Demo:
- Open the index.html file in the browser of your preference.
- Move the cursor to the play button to start video.
- Select the ending you want by moving the cursor to one of the two green buttons.
